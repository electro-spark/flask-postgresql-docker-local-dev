# About
**Local development setup for Flask and PostgreSQL. It creates fully configured Flask, PostgreSQL and NGINX Docker containers for a seamless development experience.**

‚ùó It should be used solely for local development, as it is not configured for production (the database has the authentication disabled, Flask is run with local development server etc.).

# Features
**‚úì Consistent development environment.**

**‚úì Changes of the Flask project files on host machine, are automatically propagated into the cointainer.**

# Prerequisites
